This is a very simple app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js)

A recent stage of the app should be explorable [here](https://fierce-brook-30407.herokuapp.com/). 

You can log in with:  
Username: mluukkai  
Password: sekret

(I'll add functionaly to create a user later)

It is being deployed with Heroku.

Check back every few days to monitor progress!
